        Once upon a time in the mystical land of Downtown Detroit there dwelt an
        immortal named David and his trusty band of ninja students.
      </p>
      <p class="story-text" id="b">
        They were very clever students indeed, known for their ingenious
        teamwork.
      </p>
      <p class="story-text" id="c">
        Once they were challenged by a swarm of seemingly unstoppable bugs.
      </p>
      <p class="story-text" id="d">
        But following Davidâ€™s unifying leadership, they paired up and mowed down
        their foes.
      </p>
      <p class="story-text" id="e">
        One-by-one every last pesky bug fell at the quick hands of the students.
